# Transitioning from Interface Builder to SwiftUI (INCLUDES VIDEO!)
This repo represents the SwiftUI code portion of the first chapter in my introduction to developing user interfaces in SwiftUI. This is just a small part of my series of video tutorials meant to guide people still using Interface Builder and Auto Layout into becoming proficient in Apple's new user interface paradigm, SwiftUI. When watching my video just a few lines down, you will see that, instead of plunging straight into SwiftUI code, I  highlight some similarities between SwiftUI and Interface Builder with Auto Layout, as well as discuss how the two technologies diverge. I remind you about building a login form in Interface Builder and then do it in SwiftUI -- and show you the two forms' code side-by-side. I'll give you a basic overview for starting to use SwiftUI. If you're new to SwiftUI, this video is for you. 

NOTE: This repo creates a simple login form built with SwiftUI to contrast with Interface Builder (it was written using Xcode 14.2 and Swift 5.7). The Interface Builder version of this login form is contained in my [_previous_](https://github.com/iosbrain/Interface-Builder-based-login-form) repo. Enjoy!
